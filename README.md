🌐 Web Back-End Development

A beginner-friendly overview of how the server side of the web works.

📌 What Is Back-End Development?

Back-end development focuses on everything that happens behind the scenes of a website or application — server logic, databases, APIs, security, performance, and communication between the client and the server.

A back-end application:

Receives and processes requests

Talks to the database

Applies business logic

Sends responses back to the front-end

🏗️ Core Components of Back-End
🔹 1. Server

Runs the application code and handles client requests.
Common choices:

Node.js

Python (Flask, Django, FastAPI)

PHP (Laravel, Symfony)

Java (Spring)

Ruby on Rails

🔹 2. Database

Stores data permanently.
Types:

SQL: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB

NoSQL: MongoDB, Redis, Firebase

🔹 3. API (Application Programming Interface)

Defines how the front-end communicates with the back-end.
Common patterns:

REST

GraphQL

gRPC

🔹 4. Authentication & Authorization

Controls identity and permissions.
Examples:

JWT

OAuth2

Session-based auth

🔹 5. Deployment & DevOps

Making your back-end run online.
Tools:

Docker

Nginx

GitHub Actions

AWS, DigitalOcean, Render, Vercel
